# WinDecluttered

It is a tool to optimize windows settings and uninstall unnecessary applications. Windows comes cluttered with many pre-installed unnecessary applications, marketing and advertising settings turned on. ```WinDecluttered``` helps to remove such applications, reorganizes your PC drivers and turn off marketing settings.


## Usage

Simply opening the WinDecluttered window by executing ```WinDecluttered.exe``` from the portable folder doesn't make any changes to the system. To apply many tweaks it is necessary to have administrative permission.

A portable copy of the application can be downloaded from [WinDecluttered latest](https://github.com/aazhbd/WinDecluttered/releases/latest). To use all the features run ```WinDecluttered.exe``` as administrator from right click menu.

It is also possible to download the app as a single file executable. Simply download [WinDecluttered 3.1-singleFile.exe](https://github.com/aazhbd/WinDecluttered/releases/download/WinDecluttered_v3.1/WinDecluttered_v3.1-singleFile.exe) and execute it from a writable directory to open the application, and as before run as administrator from right click menu to use all the features.
