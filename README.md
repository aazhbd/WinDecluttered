# WinDecluttered

It is an application to tweak windows settings and uninstall unnecessary applications. Windows comes cluttered with many pre-installed marketing and advertising settings turned on and unnecessary applications. ```WinDecluttered``` helps to remove such applications, reorganizes your PC drivers and turn off marketing settings.


## Usage

Simply opening the WinDecluttered window by executing ```WinDecluttered.exe``` from the portable folder doesn't make any changes to the system. To apply many tweaks it is necessary to have administrative permission.

A portable copy of the application can be downloaded from [WinDecluttered latest](https://github.com/aazhbd/WinDecluttered/releases/latest). To use all the features run ```WinDecluttered.exe``` as administrator from right click menu.
